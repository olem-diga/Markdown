# 1.4 Lists

You can organize items into ordered and unordered lists.
## Ordered Lists

To create an ordered list, add line items with numbers followed by periods. The numbers don’t have to be in numerical order, but the list should start with the number one. 
## Nesting List Items

To nest line items in an ordered list, indent the items four spaces or one tab.
## Unordered Lists

To create an unordered list, add dashes (`-`), asterisks (`*`), or plus signs (`+`) in front of line items.
## Adding Elements in Lists

 To add another element in a list while preserving the continuity of the list, indent the element four spaces or one tab.
