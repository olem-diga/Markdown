# 1.8 Links

To create a link, enclose the link text in brackets (e.g., [Duck Duck Go]) and then follow it immediately with the URL in parentheses (e.g., (https://duckduckgo.com) ). 
## Adding Titles 

You can optionally add a title for a link. This will appear as a tooltip when the user hovers over the link. To add a title, enclose it in parentheses after the URL. 
## URLs and Email Addresses

To quickly turn a URL or email address into a link, enclose it in angle brackets. 
## Formatting Links

To emphasize links, add asterisks before and after the brackets and parentheses. 
## Images 

To add an image, add an exclamation mark (`!`), followed by alt text in brackets, and the path or URL to the image asset in parentheses. You can optionally add a title after the URL in the parentheses.
