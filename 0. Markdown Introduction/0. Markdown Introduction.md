***Markdown*** is a Lightweight Markup language for creating formatted text using a plain-text-editor.

Markdown is used to write text files that can be easily converted to HTML and other formats.

Markdown is intended to be as easy-to-read and easy-to-write as is feasible. Readability is emphasized above all else.

Markdown is a fast and easy way to take notes, create content for a website, and produce print-ready documents.

Markdown has succeeded where other markup languages have failed because it strikes the right balance between power and simplicity. It’s easy to learn and simple to use.
