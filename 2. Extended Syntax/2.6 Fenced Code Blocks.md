# 2.6 Fenced Code Blocks

To create code blocks you use three tick marks (\`\`\`) or three tildes (`∼∼∼`) on the lines before and after the code block.
## Syntax Highlighting

Many Markdown processors support syntax highlighting for fenced code blocks. This feature allows you to add color highlighting for whatever language your code was written in. To add syntax highlighting, specify a language next to the tick marks before the fenced code block.

```json 
{
	"firstName": "John",
	"lastName": "Smith",
	"age": 25
} 
```
