# 2.4 Tables

To add a table, use three or more hyphens (`---`) to create each columnâ€™s header, and use pipes (`|`) to separate each column. You can optionally add pipes on either end of the table.

```markdown
| Syntax | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Header | Title |
| Paragraph | Text |
```
## Alignment

You can align text in the columns to the left, right, or center by adding a colon (`:`) to the left, right, or on both side of the hyphens within the header row.

```markdown
| Syntax | Description | Test Text |
| :--- | :----: | ---: |
| Header | Title | Here's this |
| Paragraph | Text | And more |
```
