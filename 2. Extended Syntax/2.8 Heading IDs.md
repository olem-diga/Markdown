# 2.8 Heading IDs {#olem}

Many Markdown processors support custom IDs for headings - some Markdown processors automatically add them. Adding custom IDs allows you to link directly to headings and modify them with CSS. To add a custom heading ID, enclose the custom ID in curly braces on the same line as the heading.

```markdown
### My Great Heading {#custom-id}
```
