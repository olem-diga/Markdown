# 2.9 Linking to Heading IDs

You can link to headings with custom IDs in the file by creating a standard link with a number sign (`#`) followed by the custom heading ID.

```markdown
[Heading IDs](#heading-ids)
```

Other websites can link to the heading by adding the custom heading ID to the full URL of the webpage (e.g, `[Heading IDs](https:/www.eff.org/page#heading-ids)`).
